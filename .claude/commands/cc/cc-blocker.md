think harder.

Create a Blocker Card (tight, actionable). Use evidence (logs/errors/paths) when available.

## Blocker Card
- Title (1 line):
- Symptom (what fails, exact error):
- Repro (minimal steps):
- Expected vs Actual:
- Scope (what is impacted / what is not):
- Last Known Good (if any):
- Evidence (paste snippets or cite files with @path):
- Hypotheses (ranked, 1-3):
- Next Probes (ranked, 1-3; each probe must be 1 command or 1 file change):
- Exit Criteria (how we know unblocked):
