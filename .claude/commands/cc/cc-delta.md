Using:
- Actual trail / blocker card from this session
- Research Pack (if exists; otherwise request it)
- Optional files: $ARGUMENTS

Produce a Delta Matrix.

## Delta Matrix

### 1) Goal Delta
- Plan goal (current):
- Research goal (external):
- Conflicts / mismatches:
- Proposed unified goal (must respect constraints):

### 2) Step Delta (differ1)
Classify each delta item as:
- Missing step (research has, actual lacks)
- Extra step (actual has, research doesn't need)
- Wrong order
- Wrong tool/assumption

For each item:
- Delta:
- Evidence:
- Impact:
- Fix idea:

### 3) Pitfall Delta (differ2)
- Pitfalls we hit (actual):
- Pitfalls warned by research:
- Overlap:
- Unique differences:
- Guardrails to add:

### 4) Patch List (planplus candidates)
List concrete patches:
- Patch ID:
- What to change:
- Why (which delta it closes):
- Verification:
